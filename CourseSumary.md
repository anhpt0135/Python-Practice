1. Day1, Day2:
    +input, output, print, type, list
    +list has method of append, 
    +tring has following methods:
        .capitalize() ==> Make capital at the beginning of phrase, 
        .title() in capital at beginning of each world.
        .upper(): capitalize all characters
        .lower(): make all characters lower case
2. Day2:
    How to search the code you need?
    + dir(<object>)
    + ex: dir(str)
    + help(str.capitalize)
    + help(list.append)
    + a = [1, 2, 3]
    + dir(a)
    + To get a list of variable functions in Python: 
      + import builtins
      + dir(builtins)
      
3. Day 3:
   + Recap of day2: English: the todos list is populated 
   with value over-and-over again. (Điền)
   + in Python using match case, 
     + default is an anonymous value (suggest to use _)
     + Don't need to use break as C
     + We can use bitwise OR operator in case statement.
   + Programming Tool/Concept of the Day: What surprisingly is Python:
